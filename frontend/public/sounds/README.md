# Sound Files for Enhanced Notifications

This directory should contain the following sound files for different EV levels:

## Required Files:
- `high-alert.mp3` - Loud, urgent sound for EV > 10%
- `medium-alert.mp3` - Medium sound for EV > 5%
- `low-alert.mp3` - Soft sound for EV > 2.5%

## How to Add Sounds:
1. Find or create short audio files (1-3 seconds)
2. Name them exactly as shown above
3. Place them in this directory
4. The extension will automatically use them for notifications

## Alternative:
If you don't have sound files, the notifications will still work but without audio.
The system will gracefully handle missing sound files.
